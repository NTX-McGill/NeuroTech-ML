#TODO
# Colour the channels where activation is most likely to be seen, via Michelle's observations
# Eliminate empty rows (in case where insufficient subject info)

# background white for tons of data, darker for less data?
# also this is mode blind, which could screw everything up

# Just try to interpret these 50 graphs?
# ^^ ask what features more likely to differ, which more likely to be consistent? or will model detect this?
# ^^ ask what keys are more likely to differ? but we know its space, c, and b from data trials?
