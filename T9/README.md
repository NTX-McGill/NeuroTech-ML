dic_tree.obj is an object of class Tree (defined at the top of make_dic_tree.py) 

this is the tree specified on this website [http://t9.nerevar.com/?q=details](http://t9.nerevar.com/?q=details) 

instructions on how to use and import it, at bottom of make_dic_tree.py

the file words_dictionary.json is the dictionary that I used, i got it off some other github repo

t9.py has methods that convert strings of text to strings of digits from 0-9 where 1 represents space and 0 is backspace

the main method next_input takes a single base ten digit n and a list of nodes in the dictionary-trie (Trie) and returns a list of possible string representations and the corresponding list of nodes in the Trie.
