# NeuroTech-ML

## Notes
- Every time you upload files that other people can use, add the date, file name, and a short description to file_log.txt!
- "data" directory will hold all our data. We will keep data files labelled with the date to make it easy to follow.

## Siggy upcoming goals:
Task description (markov)

Each finger is represented by a number:  
0 - left - pinky  
1 - left - ring  
2 - left - middle  
3 - left - index  
4 - left - thumb  

5 - right - pinky  
6 - right - ring
